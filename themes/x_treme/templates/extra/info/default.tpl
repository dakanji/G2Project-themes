I was born on 20/01/1966, at Linhaceira - Tomar (Portugal).
<br/><br/>
Very early I acquired a love for the plastic arts, an activity that has
continued to walk side by side with my professional affairs. I was 15 years
old when I began painting with canvas and oil paint. Unfortunately I was never
able to dedicate too much time to it.
<br/><br/>
It was much easier to reconcile a personal hobby and my professional career
through photography, an activity that takes up almost all my free time. 
<br/>
At the age of eighteen I bought my first SLR, a Yashica FX3, equipped with a 50mm
objetive, and it was with this that I took my first steps in photography.
This camera with a 70-210 mm Carl Zeiss, and later a 24 mm Carl Zeiss
became an inseparable friend for many long years.
<br/><br/>
I love to travel, which allows me to get to know and photograph other
environments.
<br/>
I like to escape to the mountains but also to plains or sunny
beaches, walking and photographing the greatest scenes offered by nature.
That's what happened in the Pyrenees mountains, Peaks of Europe (Picos de
Europa), but also at Madeira Island, Minho, or more frequently for the
proximity, the western coast of Estremadura or the always surprising and calm
Alentejo.
<br/><br/>
Still, my photographs are my best presentation !
